Golle
=====

libgolle is a library that allows individual nodes on a network to deal cards in a fully distributed way.

The algorithm was described by Phillipe Golle in his paper Dealing Cards in Poker Games[1]. This library provides an implementation of the library in order to develop distributed applications where nodes a randomly "dealt" distinct elements from a set.
