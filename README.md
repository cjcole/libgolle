Golle
=====

***libgolle*** is a library that allows individual nodes on a network to deal cards in a fully distributed way.

The algorithm was described by Phillipe Golle in his paper [Dealing Cards in Poker Games](http://crypto.stanford.edu/~pgolle/papers/poker.pdf). This library provides an implementation of the algorithm in order to develop distributed applications where nodes a randomly "dealt" distinct elements from a set.
